Meerkat All The Things

![Screenshot](multimeer.gif "Screenshot")

Got bored, messed around with Meerkat. I like it, but wanted to see all the things.  Meerkat FOMO. Now you can watch all the live meerkats at once.

It will update every 5 seconds looking for new streams, and remove old busted streams.

## How do I run this?

Probably will only work in the simulator, since it uses a ton of memory. Also, if there are alot of streams, it will use quite a bit of bandwidth. So...yeah.

```
pod install
```

Then run in XCode.

## TODO

-  Controls for sound
-  Tap to show just one stream
-  Maybe make this a mac desktop app, rather than iOS?
